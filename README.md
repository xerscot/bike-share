# Bike Share Data Analysis Tools

Some tools and their exports to clean a given dataset.

## Description

For my capstone project I chose to work on the bike sharing case study. After downloading the data I felt I had to do a bit of a clean up and organise the data for further analysis. I wrote a small program in C# to transform some of the data in the CSV files after which I was able to import them into a SQL 2019 database I had set up for the project. In the notebooks folder is a SQL notebook with the scripts from which I extracted data for my analysis. The exports folder has the csv files with my extracted data sets. Enjoy!
